  <p>üëã Welcome to ethereum.org!</p>
</h1>

<p><a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum.org</a> is a primary online resource for the Ethereum community. It is improved and changed over time through the contributions of community members who submit content, give feedback, or volunteer their time to managing its evolution.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in helping to improve <a href="https://ethereum.org">ethereum.org</a>, start here. This contribution guide will help you get started.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Ethereum.org‚Äôs design and content is guided by three core principles:</h3>

<p><strong>üåè 1. Ethereum.org is a portal to resources created by the community</strong>
  - It will never be ‚Äúencyclopedia ethereum‚Äù - we can‚Äôt add every link, or cover every topic
  - Rather, its purpose is to direct people to community-built resources
  - Ethereum.org will always have minimal native-content</p>

<p><strong>üõ† 2. Ethereum.org is a work in progress, because Ethereum is a work in progress</strong>
  - The site has been re-launched explicitly in an unfinished state
  - We expect it to change over time, including both content and design
  - To accommodate long-term changes, the site has a simple modular structure that will let us add or remove subpages</p>

<p><strong>ü¶Ñ 3. Ethereum.org is not a typical product website</strong>
  - Ethereum.org is a representation of our decentralized community, and a starting point for those who want to join it
  - Ethereum.org should not be a traditional product website like every other blockchain. There is no sales pitch.</p>

<h2>How can I contribute?</h2>

<p>Keeping in mind the above core principles, there are many ways you can get involved in improving the website!</p>

<ul>
<li>Check out the issues page and see if there are any you can help with!</li>
<li>Submit links to add to specific sections that are incomplete, by submitting a pull-request</li>
<li>Identify out-of-date information on ethereum.org (or linked to from ethereum.org) and submit a pull-request</li>
<li>Submit new designs for the front-page HERO image - find the specs <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/master/ethereum.org-hero-image-specs.pdf">here</a> and contact us at website@ethereum.org</li>
<li>Suggest ideas for new subpages, new content, or other ways to improve ethereum.org by opening an issue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes on individual sub-pages:</h2>

<p>If you want to suggest changes to particular sub-pages, keep in mind the purpose of each page:</p>

<h3>üõ† Developers</h3>

<ul>
<li>The purpose of this page is to collect core technical resources helpful to someone building on Ethereum</li>
<li>Information should be kept as up to date as possible, as new tools appear, standards are adopted, or material is deprecated</li>
<li>This page will never be completely comprehensive: the goal is to list the most popular or widely used resources or tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üìö Learn</h3>

<ul>
<li>The purpose of this page is to collect educational material about Ethereum on a variety of topics</li>
<li>Some information will be technical in nature, but it will also include non-technical information, or articles that may serve as inspiration to community members</li>
</ul>

<h3>üì± Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>This page is for the person who wants to get started using Ethereum, but doesn‚Äôt know how.</li>
<li>This page will stay limited to 3 sections: Dapps, Ether, and Wallets.</li>
<li>Useful contributions include: submitting suggestions for dapps to rotate onto this page, submitting suggestions for better links about Ether or Wallets.</li>
<li>We will rotate the list of dapps on this page frequently!</li>
<li>Dapp submissions will be assessed on the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Is the dapp a "user" application? This page is targeted at the average user, which means it wouldn't be appropriate to list a dev tool or app targeted at sophisticated technical users.</li>
<li>Does the application have a good user on-boarding proces, such that a user can follow the link, and find all the instructions they need to get started?</li>
<li>Does the application "round out" the list by adding a new kind of application not already present?</li>
<li>Is there evidence that the application is popular and well established?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>üëã Beginners</h3>

<ul>
<li>The purpose of this page is to offer a coherent answer to the most basic questions about Ethereum: what is it, and why does it exist?</li>
<li>Because this page is very simple and does not contain much content, changes to the text will be limited.</li>
<li>Useful contributions include: suggesting better ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù content to link at the bottom of the page, or suggesting images that could be added to the page to break up the text.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ü§î How are decisions about the site made?</h2>

<p>Decisions about individual PRs, design evolution, and major upgrades to the website are made by a team of people from across the Ethereum ecosystem. This team includes project managers, developers, designers, marketing and communications, and subject matter experts. Community input informs every decision: raising questions in issues, submitting PRs, or contacting the team at website@ethereum.org is helpful!</p>

<li>Anuj Gupta (Ethereum Foundation)</li>
<li>Amanda Gutterman (ConsenSys)</li>
<li>Hudson Jameson (Ethereum Foundation Devops)</li>
<li>Taeyeon Kim (Ethereum Foundation)</li>
<li>Jamie Pitts (Ethereum Foundation Devops)</li>
<li>Joseph Schweitzer (Ethereum Foundation)</li>
